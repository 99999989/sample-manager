# Sample Manager

The sample manager is a web app crafted with [Angular 2.0](angular.io) and [Webpack](webpack.github.io/) using [Materialize](materializecss.com) for styles. I create this web app in order of my bachelor thesis in business informatics at the [ZHAW](http://www.zhaw.ch) , which targets to support experience sampling projects in their management and (non-invasive) execution.
